DEPENDENCIES

math library (should already be installed by default)
silo library (https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/silo)
iof library (https://github.com/mzemp/iof)
artsfc library (https://github.com/mzemp/artsfc)
gicreader library (https://github.com/mzemp/gicreader)


COMPILATION

First, make sure you have installed all the libraries mentioned above under dependencies. The Makefile assumes that you have installed that in a local library path (e.g. ~/libraries/ under your home directory) and the following environment variable is set (e.g. in your .bashrc file):

export LOCAL_LIB_PATH=~/libraries

or that the libraries are installed in system-wide path so that the code can be linked against them.

Then clone or download the code from GitHub. In order to compile the code just type make in the conversiontools code directory:

$> make

This will generate all the conversion tools.

In order to clean up the code type:

$> make clean


HELP & OPTIONS

For each tool you can find help and a list of all command line options by calling it with the -h option like, for example:

$> tipsy_xdr_2_tipsy_nb -h
